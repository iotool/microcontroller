# IotoolSensor

* battery 
* temperature
* light / oscillation

## battery sensor

It's more of an indicator than a sensor.

* 50..100 battery charged - voltage over 3.3v
* 35..50 battery discharged - voltage less than 3.3v  
* 0..30 battery empty - voltage less than 3.1v

## temperature sensor

The cpu temperature is higher than the ambient temperature

* 43.7C cpu ~ 23C room

## light sensor

The voltage generated by the LED as a solar panel is measured.

* 7 dimmed light
* 70 sun light
* 2 low oscillation
* 50 high oscillation
